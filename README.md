Data source: Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbnb-recruiting-new-user-bookings/data

Training data1 offered by Airbnb contains 62 thousand usersâ€™ information: age, gender, registered device, browser, sign-up method, data of first booking, country destination, etc.

Training data2 contains 10 millions of their operations and time periods of the operations before first booking.

Based on this data, we will build a model to predict the country of destination of a new registered user based on his/her information and operations.
